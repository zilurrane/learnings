# Course Description

Welcome to the <b>Generative AI and Langchain Course for JavaScript Developers</b>! This course is tailored specifically for JavaScript professionals ready to advance their careers in the rapidly growing field of generative AI. While AI and machine learning have traditionally been dominated by Python, generative AI has opened up new possibilities, allowing JavaScript developers to build high-quality, LLM powered applications.

<b>Who Should Take This Course?</b> This course is designed for developers and architects with JavaScript and Node.js experience who are eager to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). You’ll learn how to use JavaScript with LangChain to create generative AI applications, mastering core concepts like RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), embeddings, vector databases, and more. By the end, you’ll be equipped to develop robust generative AI applications.

<b>Course Journey</b>: We start with setting up the development environment, creating basic applications to explore key frameworks. Then, we’ll dive into advanced topics, building real-world applications with features like retrievable augmented generation and adding conversational layers with chat history.

<b>Key Topics Covered:</b>

- <b>LangChain with JavaScript/TypeScript</b>
- <b>LLMs:</b> Working with top providers like AWS Bedrock, GPT, and Anthropic

- <b>Prompts & PromptTemplates
- Output Parsers
- Chains</b>: Including legacy chains and LCEL
- <b>LLM Parameters: Temp, Top-p, Top-k
- LangSmith
- Embeddings & VectorStores</b> (e.g., Pinecone)
- <b>RAG</b> (Retrieval Augmentation Generation)
- <b>Tools</b>: Web crawlers, document loaders, text splitters
- <b>Memory & Chat History</b>

Throughout the course, you’ll engage in hands-on exercises and build real-world projects to reinforce each concept, ensuring a solid foundation in generative AI with JavaScript. By course completion, you’ll be proficient in using LangChain to develop versatile, high-performance LLM applications.

<b>What’s Included</b>? This course is also a community experience. With lifetime access, you’ll receive:

- GitHub repositories with complete course code

- Access to an exclusive Discord community for support and discussion on GenAI topics

- Free updates and continuous improvements at no extra cost

<b>Disclaimers</b>:

- This is not a beginner course; software engineering experience and some experience in JavaScript are assumed.

- We will be using the VSCode IDE (though any editor is welcome).

- Some LLM services may require payment, but we’ll utilize free options whenever possible.
